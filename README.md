# Mouse Tumor Volume Analysis
This repository contains a Python-based analysis of mouse tumor volume data for various drug regimens. The project demonstrates advanced data processing, statistical analysis, and visualization using Pandas, Matplotlib, and SciPy.

***Key Features***
Data Preparation:

Merges datasets into a single DataFrame.

Identifies and removes duplicate entries.

Displays the number of mice before and after cleaning.

***Statistical Analysis:***

Calculates summary statistics (mean, median, variance, standard deviation, SEM) for tumor volumes across regimens.

***Visualizations:***

Bar charts and pie charts to display data distribution.

Box plots for identifying outliers in tumor volumes.

Line and scatter plots to track trends and correlations.

***Outlier Detection and Regression:***

Identifies interquartile ranges (IQR) and outliers for key treatment groups.

Calculates correlation coefficients and performs linear regression for Capomulin regimen data.

***How to Use***
Clone the repository.

Install necessary libraries (e.g., Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy).

Run the script to perform the analysis and generate results.

***Repository Contents***
